            <p>Welcome to Tent! These terms govern your use of the Tent App and all its services, ensuring a safe and enjoyable experience for all users. By accessing or using the Tent App, you agree to comply with these terms.</p>

            <h2>1. User Responsibilities</h2>
            <p>
                As a Tent user, you are expected to use the app responsibly and in accordance with all applicable laws.

            <p>
                All ticket purchases and in-event transactions made through the Tent App are subject to our payment terms.

            <h2>3. Content Sharing</h2>
            <p>
